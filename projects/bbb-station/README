For security reasons, the file "secure" is omitted from in this repo.
You have to (should) create it with the following content:

# Start of "secure" file

WPA_STA=<station to connect to at startup>
WPA_PSW=<password of that AP>

SSH_KEYS=("<ssh-rsa key 1>" "<ssh-rsa key 2>" "<...>")

# end

Ex:
WPA_STA=my-local-wifi
WPA_PSW=the_password

SSH_KEYS=("ssh-rsa AAAB..... someone@somewhere.com")

That file will be included into the build process when needed.
